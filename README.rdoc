A collection of lazy and persistent data structures and mixins for
Ruby that provide support for a more functional programming style.

Lazy evaluation is a technique in which computations are deferred
until their results are first used (which may be never). Pazy provides
lazy (cached) attributes as well as an extension of the enumerable
module that defers the execution of list manipulation methods until
particular values are accessed.

Persistent data structures are immutable data structures with shared
information between instances. Any modification operation on such a
structure will create a new instance while leaving the original one
intact. This eliminates the need for manipulating data in place while
at the same time avoiding the high cost of copying the complete
structure.

Portions of this code were ported from the Clojure runtime system.
